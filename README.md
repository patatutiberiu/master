## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start locally:**
```bash
# Make sure you have Python 3.8+
python --version

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try running with full path
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

**Deployment fails:**
- Make sure your repository is **public**
- Check that all files are uploaded to GitHub
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

**App is slow:**
